Absolutely! Here’s a ready-to-go **GitHub repo structure** with a polished README, a sample `.gitignore`, and a brief `requirements.txt`. This is designed for a non-technical user but still looks professional and clear for academic/professional context.

# Admissions Excel File Updater

A simple Streamlit app to help you update and synchronize MPA applicant data.  
Upload your latest university CSV and your master Excel sheet, and this app will merge changes, exclude certain applicants, and provide a ready-to-download updated Excel file.  
**No coding required!**

## Features

- Simple drag-and-drop interface
- Merges new admissions data with your master Excel file
- Excludes applicants with `'37POSCPMA'` in `acad_plan`
- Updates changed records and adds new applicants
- Runs on Mac or Windows (locally, no data leaves your computer)

## How to Use

1. **Install Prerequisites**

   Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
   
   Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Start the App**

   From Terminal, run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run admissions_app.py
   ```

   This will open a browser window with the app.

3. **Upload Your Files**

   * **University CSV file:** The latest admissions export
   * **Current Excel file:** Your master applicant sheet

   The app will process and give you a download link for the updated Excel file.

## Tips

* If the Excel file does not exist yet, create it with at least an `id` column.
* The columns in your files should include an `id` field to match records.
* The output file is fully compatible with Excel and can be shared as usual.

## For Developers

To create a double-clickable launcher on Mac, see instructions in the README or the included `Run Admissions App.command` script.
